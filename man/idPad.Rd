\description{
This function converts an all-integer employee ID into a specified format
that includes leading zeroes. HR systems often create employee IDs that have leading zeroes.
The leading zeroes can be lost when they are worked on in Excel or other tools. It's usually
helpful to convert the IDs back the correct format when performing lookups.
