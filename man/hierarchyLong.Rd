\description{
This function takes employee and supervisor
identifiers (name, ID, etc.) and returns a long data frame consisting of
one row per employee for every supervisor above them, up to the CEO.

The resulting format is useful for quickly filtering to a specific
part of the workforce that directly and indirectly reports up through
a particular leader.
